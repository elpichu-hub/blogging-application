# Django-React Blogging Application with Real-Time Features

Welcome to my proof of concept blogging application that combines the power of Django, React, Django Channels, Redis, and Django Rest Framework. 
This application showcases a live chat functionality, liking and disliking posts, as well as commenting on blog posts. It's a great example of using modern technologies to create interactive and real-time features.

## Features

- Live Chat: Engage in real-time conversations with other users using Django Channels and Redis.
- Like and Dislike: Express your opinions on blog posts by liking or disliking them.
- Commenting: Interact with the blog community by adding comments to posts.
- Django Rest Framework: Utilizes DRF for building the API endpoints required for the frontend to communicate with the backend.

## Tech Stack

- Django: A powerful Python web framework used for the backend.
- Django Rest Framework: Provides API endpoints for interacting with the application.
- Django Channels: Enables the real-time functionality through WebSockets.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redis: In-memory data store used for caching and as a backing store for Django Channels.
- PostgreSQL: A relational database used to store blog posts, comments, and user information.
